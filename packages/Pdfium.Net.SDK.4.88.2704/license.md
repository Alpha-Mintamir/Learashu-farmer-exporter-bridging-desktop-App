       source code. You may modify the source code for your own needs as part of a non-competing compiled
       solution but may not redistribute it in non-compiled form. Source code is subject to the following
       conditions:
       ▪ PATAGAMES shall retain all rights, title and interest in and to all corrections, modifications and
          derivative works of the source code created by you, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the
          extent such corrections, modifications or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression
          derived from the source code;
       ▪ You also agree to acknowledge and deliver to PATAGAMES all related information for said
          corrections, modifications, or derivatives;
       ▪ You may not distribute or disclose the source code, or any portions or modifications or derivative

          reasonable need to know said Confidential Information.; The LICENSEE agrees that money

          entitled to seek injunction or other equitable relief to remedy or prevent any breach or threatened
          breach of this clause. Such remedy shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach of this clause,
          but shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity;
       ▪ If you distribute a compiled version of the corrected source code or portions thereof, you must

- For the sake of flexibility, the licenses permit the AUTHORIZED USER to install the LICENSED
    SOFTWARE on a laptop computer that the AUTHORIZED USER uses if the original installation was on a
    desktop. Similarly, if the original installation was on a laptop, the AUTHORIZED USER can install and use
    the LICENSED SOFTWARE on desktop computer that the AUTHORIZED USER uses. However, the
    AUTHORIZED USER should not install the LICENSED SOFTWARE on two desktop computers or two
    laptop computers.
- The AUTHORIZED USER can "move" the installation to another computer by first uninstalling the
    LICENSED SOFTWARE on the original computer and permanently removing any traces of its existence on
    that computer and then installing the LICENSED SOFTWARE on the other computer.

## OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS

- Activation. The LICENSED SOFTWARE contains technological measures that are designed to prevent
    its unlicensed or illegal use. The LICENSED SOFTWARE may contain enforcement technology that
    limits LICENSEE’s ability to install and uninstall the LICENSED SOFTWARE on a machine to no more
    than a finite number of times, and for a finite number of machines. If any such applicable activation
    procedure(s) are not followed, then the LICENSED SOFTWARE may only operate for a finite period of
    time. If LICENSEE has any problem with the activation process, LICENSEE should contact
    PATAGAMES customer support. The absence of any activation measures shall not be taken to mean
    that PATAGAMES consent to any use of the LICENSED SOFTWARE beyond the uses permitted in this
    Agreement.
- Ceases Operations. In the event that PATAGAMES ceases product support or business operations and
    no surviving entity owns the rights to the source code, then you may retain and continue to use the
    Code only under the terms outlined in this EULA.

    only, provided that such copies shall be used only for internal purposes and are not republished or

    LICENSED SOFTWARE is via your DEVELOPED SOFTWARE only. Non-LICENSEEs will not be
    permitted direct access to the LICENSED SOFTWARE.
- The LICENSED SOFTWARE may be installed on a third-party hosting server as long as each person

    doubt you may not solicit, canvas, approach or accept any approach from any person with a view to
    utilizing the Code to compete with the business of PATAGAMES in any way or otherwise be concerned
    with or interested in (whether as trustee, principal, agent, shareholder, unit holder or in any other
    capacity) any business which uses the Code to carry on the same, substantially similar to or competitive
    with the business of PATAGAMES or be employed by, work for or contract or consult to (directly or
    indirectly, whether or not for remuneration, and in any capacity) any business which uses the Code to
    carry on business the same, substantially similar to or competitive with the business of PATAGAMES.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The LICENSEE acknowledges that the LICENSED SOFTWARE is designed to interact with and modify the
properties of documents, although unlikely, this may cause errors and the LICENSEE acknowledges that
PATAGAMES recommends that the LICENSEE backs up their documents. PATAGAMES will not be liable for
any loss associated with such an issue nor shall it be considered as a defect of the LICENSED SOFTWARE.


## CONTENT

LICENSEE may use any clip art, photographs, icons, fonts, shapes, animations, sounds, music, video clips, and
all other graphic content (collectively, “Content”) included with the LICENSED SOFTWARE, if any, only as
stated in the Documentation. If the Documentation does not permit LICENSEE to use the Content, then
LICENSEE may not display, modify, reproduce, or distribute any of the Content; and even if the
Documentation permits LICENSEE to use the Content, LICENSEE may not distribute the Content on a stand-
alone basis such as where the Content constitutes the primary value of whatever LICENSEE is distributing.

Certain portions of the Content may consist of the copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, or other
intellectual property of third parties. PATAGAMES has provided these portions of the Content for LICENSEEs’
convenience in using the LICENSED SOFTWARE, pursuant to authorization of their owners. Except for this
limited use, LICENSEE may not use any third-party intellectual property identified as belonging to others
without the owners’ express authorization. Furthermore:

- LICENSEE may not sell, license, distribute (commercially or otherwise), or make available the Content as
    stand-alone images or sounds, or in catalogs, design books, compilations, collections, templates, designs,
    stock engravings, products, services, or the like;
- LICENSEE may not sell, license, distribute (commercially or otherwise), or make available electronic copies
    of the Content to third parties in any manner, including without limitation, via the Internet, on any tangible
    media or by broadcast, that is intended or designed to enable a third party to copy the Content for its own
    use;
- LICENSEE may not sell, license, distribute (commercially or otherwise), or make available electronic copies
    of the Content that includes representations of identifiable individuals, governments, logos, initials,
    emblems, trademarks, or entities that expresses or implies any endorsement or association with any
    product, service, entity, or activity;
- Under no circumstances may the Content be used in the production of defamatory, fraudulent, infringing,
    lewd, obscene, or pornographic material, or in any otherwise illegal manner.

LICENSEE is solely responsible for LICENSEE’s use of the Content. LICENSEE may only use the Content
responsibly, in a manner consistent with the exercise of good judgment. If LICENSEE is having difficulty
deciding whether Licensee’s intended use is appropriate, or whether LICENSEE needs written permission, or
whether other legal issues should be considered, PATAGAMES strongly encourages LICENSEE to seek
competent legal counsel. PATAGAMES will not assist LICENSEE in making this determination, nor can
PATAGAMES provide LICENSEE with legal advice as to intellectual property rights.

If LICENSEE or Licensee’s attorney determines that LICENSEE is required by law to obtain written permission
to use portions of the Content, LICENSEE must request permission in writing for reproduction, redistribution,
or modification of the Content from the appropriate owner of the subject materials (as may be cited in the
LICENSED SOFTWARE). If, on the other hand, LICENSEE or LICENSEE’s attorney determines it is
permissible to proceed and include Content from the LICENSED SOFTWARE, PATAGAMES asks LICENSEE
to correctly designate PATAGAMES trademark(s) when referring to the LICENSED SOFTWARE in the notice
or copyright portion of Licensee’s paper, project, or product.

LICENSEE shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend PATAGAMES and PATAGAMES suppliers from all
claims, damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and lawsuits that arise from, or result from, Licensee’s use or
distribution of Content without limitation and howsoever arising.


## SOFTWARE UPDATES

If a new release of the software is produced within 12 months from the date of purchase, then LICENSEE will
be entitled to a free upgrade. This agreement may be extended by explicit purchase of additional lights. The
license does not grant you any right to any enhancement or update beyond the initial 12 - month period,
commencing from the date of purchase. The license does not indicate a Service Level Agreement, nor does it
imply that PATAGAMES is responsible for successful deployment, maintenance nor business function of the
LICENSED SOFTWARE.

If the LICENSED SOFTWARE is an Update to previous version, LICENSEE must possess a valid License to the
previous version. Any Update provided to LICENSEE is made on a License exchange basis such that
LICENSEE agrees, as a condition for receiving an Update, that LICENSEE will terminate all of LICENSEE’s
rights to use any previous version of the LICENSED SOFTWARE. However, LICENSEE may continue to use
the previous version only to assist in transitioning to the Updated version. Once an Update has been released,
PATAGAMES may cease support for prior versions, without any notice to LICENSEE. The terms of this
LICENSE AGREEMENT shall survive any update save for any new term agreed between the LICENSEE and
PATAGAMES which directly replaces any term of this LICENSE AGREEMENT.

## SUPPORT

PATAGAMES is not obligated by this EULA to provide LICENSEE with any technical support services relating
to the LICENSED SOFTWARE; however, LICENSEE may order additional support services for an additional
charge as PATAGAMES may offer from time to time during the term of this EULA.

## NO WARRANTY ON LICENSED SOFTWARE

The LICENSED SOFTWARE is provided to LICENSEE “AS IS.” PATAGAMES, and PATAGAMES suppliers,
make no warranty as to its use or performance. PATAGAMES, and PATAGAMES suppliers, make no
warranties, conditions, representations, or terms (express or implied whether by statute, common law, custom,
usage, or otherwise) as to any matter including without limitation non-infringement of third party rights,
merchantability, integration, satisfactory quality, or fitness for any particular purpose, except for, and to the
extent, that a warranty may not be excluded or limited by applicable law in licensee’s jurisdiction.

## LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In no event will PATAGAMES, or PATAGAMES suppliers, be liable to licensee for any damages, claims, or
costs whatsoever, or for any consequential, indirect, incidental damages, or any lost profits or lost savings, even
if a representative of PATAGAMES or one of PATAGAMES suppliers has been advised of the possibility of such
loss, damages, claims, or costs, or for any claim by any third party. These limitations and exclusions apply to
the extent permitted by applicable law in licensee’s jurisdiction. The aggregate liability of PATAGAMES, and
PATAGAMES suppliers, under or in connection with this EULA, shall be limited to the amount paid for the
licensed software, if any.

## ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR BETA SOFTWARE

If the LICENSED SOFTWARE that LICENSEE receives with this EULA is pre-commercial release or “BETA”
software (“Pre-release-Software”), then, to the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any
other term or condition in this EULA, this section supersedes such conflicting term(s) and condition(s) as to
the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.

LICENSEE acknowledges that the Pre-release Software does not represent the final product from
PATAGAMES, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and
data loss. Consequently, PATAGAMES disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to LICENSEE of any kind
whatsoever.


### IN APPLICABLE JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE

### SOFTWARE,BUT MAY BE LIMITED, PATAGAMES LIABILITY, AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS, SHALL BE

### LIMITED TO THE TOTAL OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. $50.00).

LICENSEE acknowledges that PATAGAMES has not promised or guaranteed to LICENSEE that the Pre-
release Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, and that PATAGAMES has no
express or implied obligation to LICENSEE to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software. PATAGAMES
may decide not to introduce a product similar to, or compatible with, the Pre-release Software. Accordingly,
LICENSEE acknowledges that any research or development that LICENSEE performs regarding the Pre-
release Software, or any product associated with the Pre-release Software, is done entirely at LICENSEE’s own
risk.

During the term of this EULA, if requested by PATAGAMES, LICENSEE will provide feedback to PATAGAMES
regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports.

If LICENSEE has been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, then
LICENSEE’s use of the Pre-release Software is also governed by that agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this EULA to the contrary, LICENSEE will return or destroy all unreleased versions of the Pre-release Software
within 30 days of the completion of Licensee’s testing of the Pre-release Software if that date is earlier than the
date scheduled for PATAGAMES first commercial shipment of the publicly released(commercial) Software.

## SURVIVAL OF DISCLAIMERS

The exclusions of warranties and liability limitations shall survive the termination of this EULA, howsoever
caused; but this survival shall not imply or create any continued right to use the LICENSED SOFTWARE after
termination of this EULA.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

The LICENSED SOFTWARE and any authorized copies that LICENSEE makes are the intellectual property of,
and are owned by PATAGAMES, and by third parties whose intellectual property has been licensed by
PATAGAMES. The structure, organization, and code of the LICENSED SOFTWARE are the valuable trade
secrets and confidential information of PATAGAMES and such third parties. The LICENSED SOFTWARE is
protected by law, including without limitation, the copyright laws of Australia, the United States and other
countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as expressly provided in this EULA, LICENSEE is not
granted any intellectual property rights in the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

## RESERVATION OF RIGHTS

PATAGAMES reserves all rights not expressly granted to LICENSEE by this EULA. The rights granted to
LICENSEE are limited to PATAGAMES’s intellectual property rights, and to the intellectual property rights of
third parties licensed by PATAGAMES, and do not include any intellectual property rights.

## COMPLETE AGREEMENT

This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between the LICENSEE and PATAGAMES relating to the
LICENSED SOFTWARE, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions,
undertakings, communications, agreements, arrangements, advertisements, and understandings regulating to
the LICENSED SOFTWARE.

## MODIFICATION

This EULA may only be modified or amended by a writing signed by an authorized officer of PATAGAMES.


## SEVER ABILITY

If any provision of this EULA is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, that
provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of this EULA will
remain in full force and effect.

## WAIVER

No failure or delay by PATAGAMES in exercising its rights or remedies shall operate as waiver unless made by
specific written notice. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy of PATAGAMES shall operate as a
waiver or preclude any other, or further, exercise of that, or any other right, or remedy.
